# links2File
This package can be used to : 

1. create a list of files with their corresponding description and classification.
2. generate a browser sheet that allows navigating through the files included in the list.

Is main goal is to use in combination with a workflow that generates possibly many different files. Everytime you write a file to disk add a new line to the "linksfile" and then generation of the browser is almost automatic.
